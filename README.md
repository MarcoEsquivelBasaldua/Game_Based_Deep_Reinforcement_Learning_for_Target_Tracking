# Game Based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Target Tracking
Author: Marco Antonio Esquivel Basaldua

In this repo reside the codes used in the thesis "Game Based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Target Tracking". They are organized as follows:
    - Environment Discretization and Deterministic Motion Policies with Discrete Optimal Planing
    - Data set Generation and Motion Policies in the Continuous State-Space with Artificial Neural Networks
    - Motion Policies Improvement with Deep Reinforcement Learning
