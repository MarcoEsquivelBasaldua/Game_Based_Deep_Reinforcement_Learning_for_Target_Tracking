# One initial position

1. Run e-greedy.ipynb notebook to train the pursuer model from scratch.
2. Run e-greedy_MPI.ipynb notebook to train the pursuer model from scratch using middle states for training.
3. Run e-greedy_initialization.ipynb notebook to train the pursuer model using a pretrained model weights as initialization.
4. Run e-greedy_MPI_initialization.ipynb notebook to train the pursuer model using a pretrained model weights as initialization and middle states for training.
5. Run e-greedy_initialization.ipynb notebook to train the pursuer model using a pretrained model as a Master policy.
8. Run e-greedy_initialization.ipynb notebook to train the pursuer model using a pretrained model as a Master policy and middle states for training.
9. Simulations can be done with file simulation_evader_fixed_trajectory_fixed_start_location.py
