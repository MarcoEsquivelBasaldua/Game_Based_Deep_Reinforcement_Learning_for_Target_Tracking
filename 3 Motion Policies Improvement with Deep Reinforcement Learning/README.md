# Motion Policies Improvement with Deep Reinforcement Learning

This section is separated in two:
- One initial position: Only applies for Env1. Training and simulation are considered from a single initial state only.
- Multiple initial positions: Applies for Env1 and Env3. This is a generalized case where training and simulation are done in any initial state.
